This project is a small demo application for learning microservices architecture and containerization using Docker. 

It includes two services: User Service and Order Service: 

Both services are built with Spring Boot and interact with MongoDB for data persistence. 
The application is containerized using Docker and managed with Maven. Unit tests are written using Mockito.
